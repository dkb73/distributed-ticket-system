## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running.
- Git installed.

### 1. Clone & Navigate

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd distributed-ticket-system
```

### 2. Start the System

The startup script handles database initialization and starts all services in the correct order.

On Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
.\start-services.bat
```

On Linux/macOS:

```bash
chmod +x start-services.sh
./start-services.sh
```

This process will take a few minutes on the first run as it downloads and builds all the necessary container images.

### 3. Verify

After the script completes, check that all services are healthy:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All services should have a STATUS of `Up` or `running (healthy)`.

## üì° API Usage (via Gateway)

All requests should be made to the NGINX Gateway at **http://localhost:8080**.

<br/>

<details>
<summary><strong>GET /api/events</strong> ‚Äî List all available events</summary>

**Description:** Retrieves a summary of all events in the system. To keep the payload small and fast, this endpoint intentionally excludes the detailed seat map.

**Method:** GET

**URL:** `http://localhost:8080/api/events`

**Success Response (200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "68b485fddd8d6e30ae07e94b",
    "event_id": "concert123",
    "date": "2025-09-01T11:58:36.000Z",
    "name": "Event concert123"
  },
  {
    "_id": "68b485fddd8d6e30ae07e952",
    "event_id": "sports_event456",
    "date": "2025-09-01T11:58:36.000Z",
    "name": "Event sports_event456"
  }
]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GET /api/events/:id</strong> ‚Äî Get details and seat map for a single event</summary>

**Description:** Retrieves the full details for a specific event, including the real-time status of every seat.

**Method:** GET

**URL:** `http://localhost:8080/api/events/concert123`

**Success Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "_id": "68b485fddd8d6e30ae07e94b",
  "event_id": "concert123",
  "date": "2025-09-01T11:58:36.000Z",
  "name": "Event concert123",
  "seats": [
    { "seat_id": "A1", "status": "available", "user_id": null },
    { "seat_id": "A2", "status": "available", "user_id": null },
    { "seat_id": "A3", "status": "available", "user_id": null }
  ]
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>POST /api/book</strong> ‚Äî Request to book a ticket</summary>

**Description:** Submits an asynchronous request to book a specific seat. The system responds immediately and processes the booking in the background.

**Method:** POST

**URL:** `http://localhost:8080/api/book`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "eventId": "concert123",
  "seatId": "A2"
}
```

**Success Response (202 Accepted):**
```json
{
  "message": "Booking request received and is being processed."
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues where services are not starting correctly or the Docker environment seems stuck, you can perform a full reset.

<details>
<summary><strong>üö® Emergency Reset: Force-Clean Docker Environment</strong></summary>

**Warning:** These commands are destructive and will remove all containers, volumes (deleting your database data), and unused images on your system.

```bash
# Step 1: 
docker-compose down

# Step 2: flush db data
docker volume rm distributed-ticket-system_postgres_data
>> docker volume rm distributed-ticket-system_mongo_data

# Step 3: Forcefully stop all running containers
# This is useful if 'docker-compose down' hangs.
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

# Step 4: Forcefully remove all containers (running or stopped)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Step 5: Prune the entire Docker system
# This removes all stopped containers, all networks, all volumes,
# all unused images, and all build cache.
docker system prune -a --volumes

# When prompted, type 'y' and press Enter

# Then re-run .\start-services.bat
```

After running these commands, your Docker environment will be completely clean, and you can run the startup script again.
